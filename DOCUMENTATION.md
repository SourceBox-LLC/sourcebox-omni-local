## Performance Optimization

### System Resource Usage
The application displays CPU, RAM, and GPU usage in the status bar to help you monitor performance. If you notice the application running slowly:

1. Try switching to a smaller, more efficient AI model
2. Close other resource-intensive applications
3. Ensure your computer meets the recommended system requirements

### Model Selection
Different models offer different balances of speed and capabilities:

- Larger models (8-70B parameters) provide better responses but require more resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ollama Not Connecting**
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running (check for the Ollama icon in your system tray)
- Restart the Ollama service if needed
- Verify no firewall is blocking the connection

**Slow AI Responses**
- Switch to a smaller AI model
- Check your system resources (CPU/RAM usage)
- Ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements

**File Upload Problems**
- Check that the file type is supported
- Ensure the file isn't too large (stay under 20MB per file)
- Verify you have read permissions for the file
